# Issue Summary
The catastrophe took place between 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM MST on June 30th, 2017. The morning had been going well in the shop but one thing seemed to have everyone in the storefront on edge. For a solid hour there had been no music playing in the shop. This had resulted in a 70% decrease in customer satisfaction as well as a 90% drop in sales.

#Timeline
* 9:00 AM - The storefront opens like any other day.
* 9:15 AM - Fifteen minutes since opening and only one customer has wandered in. Shortly after being enveloped in the silence slips out feeling awkward and ashamed.
* 9:20 AM - I come out into the storefront to take inventory and feel the same feeling creeping up on me as the last customer. I am unable to pinpoint why this is happening at this moment.
* 9:50 AM - I walk back into the storefront to restock and notice Sandy, the lady that runs the printer in the shop, has fallen asleep due to the silence.
* 10:00 AM - Sandy finally wakes after ten minutes of me trying to shake her awake.
* 10:15 AM - Other customers have been falling asleep in the store so I wake them up. One customer is curled up in the fetal position on the ground shaking. I overhear him muttering something about how the silence is killing him.
* 10:20 AM - After pondering the customers words I suddenly realise what has gone wrong in the store.
* 10:21 AM - I rush towards the aux cord in the back room to put on some groovy tunes, hoping that will revive the store.
* 10:22 AM - I find the song that no one cant help bobbing their head to, Dean Town by Vulfpeck, and press play.
* 10:24 AM - The store front in now poppin. People are dancing in the shop while they look at shirts and Sandy is boogying away while printing.
* 10:30 AM - Everything is back to normal.

#Root Cause
The root cause of this issue was that I had failed to remeber that Claire had Tuesdays off. Claire usually arrives to work early to secure the music.

#Resolution
Due to my innate deductive reasoning skills I figured out the problem and saved the store from total annihilation.

#Preventive Measures
After the incident I made sure everyone knew how important the responsibilty of playing music in the shop is. The responisbility is not only Claire's
